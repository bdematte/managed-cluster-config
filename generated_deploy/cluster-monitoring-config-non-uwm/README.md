# Cluster Monitoring Config

Cluster monitoring config file content can now be found in [resources/cluster-monitoring-config/config.yaml](../../resources/cluster-monitoring-config/config.yaml).

The ConfigMap is generated using the script [scripts/generate-cmo-config.py](../../scripts/generate-cmo-config.py).

This is to ensure parity between UWM and non-UWM deployments.
